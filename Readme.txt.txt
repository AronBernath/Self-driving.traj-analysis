The goal is to evaluate and analyse data, collected from a self-driving car's sensors. Data was collected from city and highway enviroenements. The three main tasks:

- Check the quality of data, deletion of corrupted or missing data.
- Describe the data, based on some parameters.
- Define every objects relevance from the perspective of our vehicle, using trajectory analysis. Relevancy should be described on a scale of [0; 1]. Relevant vehicle means that, the specified vehicle(s), in some form, are more important, than others. Perhaps, we might be interracting with them at some point, we have to change our direction etc.
